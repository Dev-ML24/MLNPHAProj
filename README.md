## üìÅ Project Structure
This repository contains both the **Jupyter Notebooks** used for implementation and the **IEEE-style LaTeX research report** written on Overleaf. The goal of the project is to develop and compare multiple machine learning classification models to predict the number of doctors an older adult visits in a year.

## üì¶ Deliverables

### ‚úÖ 1. Jupyter Notebooks
All code is written in well-documented and fully reproducible Jupyter notebooks. The outputs, visualizations, and final results **exactly match** those presented in the research report. Notebooks include:

- **Data Preprocessing & EDA**  
  Handling missing data, normalization, visualization, correlation matrices, and PCA-based dimensionality reduction.

- **Modeling - Logistic Regression**  
  Implementation, training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation of logistic regression.

- **Modeling - Decision Tree**  
  Model building, hyperparameter analysis, visualizations (including decision boundaries), and evaluation metrics.

- **Modeling - Random Forest & AdaBoost**  
  Training, cross-validation, performance comparison, and final evaluation.

- **Comparison & Results**  
  Side-by-side comparison of all models based on accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC curves.

### ‚úÖ 2. Research Report (IEEE Format, written in LaTeX)
A full-length report in IEEE format, written collaboratively on Overleaf. The report includes the following sections:

1. **Abstract**: Concise overview of the project with techniques and results (within 150 words).
2. **Introduction**: Motivation, methodology, key insights, and report structure.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Summary statistics, feature distribution, PCA projection, and data cleaning.
4. **Model Discussions**:  
   - **Logistic Regression**  
   - **Decision Trees**  
   - **Random Forest**  
   - **AdaBoost**  
   Each section includes theoretical background, equations, training results, and evaluation metrics.
5. **Comparison**: Summary tables, figures, and a final model performance comparison.
6. **Conclusion**: Project outcomes, limitations, and future work directions.

The report includes **at least 10 academic and technical references** and proposes additional improvements for potential bonus marks.

## üìä Key Findings

- **Non-linear separability** of the dataset confirmed using PCA and decision tree boundaries.
- **Decision Tree and Random Forest** models outperformed Logistic Regression in accuracy and F1-score.
- **Visualization of Decision Boundaries** helped demonstrate model behavior.
- Limitations include class imbalance and small dataset size.
- Proposed future directions include SMOTE, deep learning models, and incorporating external data.
